      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        The Technical Airworthiness Authority (TAA) is responsible for the
        regulation of the technical airworthiness aspects of the design,
        manufacture, maintenance, and materiel support of aeronautical products.
        The TAA ensures the airworthiness acceptability of those products before
        operational service.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TAA is designated by the Chief of Defence Staff, directed by the
        Minister of National Defence, and held by the Director General Aerospace
        Equipment Program Management (DGAEPM) for the department.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TAA provides airworthiness-related services to the Canadian military
        aviation community, including the airworthiness acceptability of
        organizations supporting CAF-registered aircraft, organization and
        coordination of the Airworthiness Review Board, and technical
        airworthiness training.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TAA develops rules, standards, and guidance documents to support
        DND/CAF organizations in their airworthiness-related activities. These
        documents include the Technical Airworthiness Manual (TAM),
        Airworthiness Design Standards Manual (ADSM), TAA Advisories, and
        Airworthiness Directives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Technical Airworthiness Program, implemented and monitored by the
        TAA, ensures an acceptable level of safety by following a regulatory
        approach. The program relies on rules, standards, directives, and
        advisory material, with organizations developing customized processes
        and procedures assessed for compliance against the TAA-issued rules and
        standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day-to-day management of the Technical Airworthiness Program is
        assigned to the Director - Technical Airworthiness and Engineering
        Support (DTAES). For more information about the Technical Airworthiness
        Program, please contact DTAES 2-2 at{" "}
